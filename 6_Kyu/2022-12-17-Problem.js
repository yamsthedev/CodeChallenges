The aim of the kata is to try to show how difficult it can be to calculate decimals of an irrational number with a certain precision. We have chosen to get a few decimals of the number "pi" using the following infinite series (Leibniz 1646â€“1716):

PI / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... which gives an approximation of PI / 4.

To have a measure of the difficulty we will count how many iterations are needed to calculate PI with a given precision of epsilon.

There are several ways to determine the precision of the calculus but to keep things easy we will calculate PI within epsilon of your language Math::PI constant.

In other words, given as input a precision of epsilon we will stop the iterative process when the absolute value of the difference between our calculation using the Leibniz series and the Math::PI constant of your language is less than epsilon.

Your function returns an array or a string or a tuple depending on the language (See sample tests) with

your number of iterations
your approximation of PI with 10 decimals
Example :
Given epsilon = 0.001 your function gets an approximation of 3.140592653839794 for PI at the end of 1000 iterations : since you are within epsilon of Math::PI you return

iter_pi(0.001) --> [1000, 3.1405926538]
Notes :
Unfortunately, this series converges too slowly to be useful, as it takes over 300 terms to obtain a 2 decimal place precision. To obtain 100 decimal places of PI, it was calculated that one would need to use at least 10^50 terms of this expansion!

function iterPi(epsilon) {
  let ans = 1
  let i = 3
  let plusOrMinus = -1
  let iterations = 1
  
  while(Math.abs(Math.PI - ans*4) > epsilon){
    ans += plusOrMinus*1/i
    i+=2
    plusOrMinus > 0 ? plusOrMinus = -1 : plusOrMinus = 1
    iterations++
  }
  return [iterations, Number((ans*4).toFixed(10))]
}

// Alternative Answer
function iterPi(epsilon) {
	var pi = 0, iterations = 0, factor = 1, divider = 1;
  while (Math.abs(Math.PI - (pi * 4)) >= epsilon) {
    pi += factor / divider;
    factor = -factor;
    divider += 2;
    iterations += 1;
  }
  return [iterations, +(pi * 4).toFixed(10)];
}

// Alternative Answer
function iterPi(epsilon) {
  let [res, i]= [0, 0];
  for (; Math.abs( Math.PI/4-res) > epsilon/4; i++)
      res +=  (i%2 ? -1 : 1) / (1 + 2*i)  ; 
  return [i, +(res*4).toFixed(10)];
